## Developing

Before developing you'll need to install dependencies with `npm install`. The following commands can then be used:

- `npm start` - runs the site on http://localhost:8080 for local development. The site will be rebuilt if there are any changes.
- `npm run build` - builds the site and outputs to `./_site/`.
